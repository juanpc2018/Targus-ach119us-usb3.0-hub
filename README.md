small review....

has:
1x micro-USB B 3.0 port to PC/Mac host USB 3.0 A port "input"
1x USB 3.0 micro-B to A cable, fat bold cable = good quality.
1x small Blue LED when connected to host or AC-DC adapter.
3x Blue USB 3.0 A-ports. 1Amp each "Outputs", in theory.
1x Black USB 3.0 that should be Red: "4Amp / Fast Charge", in theory.
1x AC-DC Adapter 5v 4A "in theory", actually: 4.9vdc.
most digital devices fail when voltage is over 5.2vdc because dont have internal voltage regulators, 
only when DC input is 9v-12v or more includes internal voltage regulators. 
4.5v is the minimum threshold, but 4.8v is with in tolerance values.
5.2v is the maximum useable limit.
Apple original Ac-DC adapter A1401 has 5.2vdc 2.4Amps.
Belkin USB2.0 F5U404-BLK is a nice usb2.0 hub, but ac-dc adapter has 5.3vdc, and mini-USB cable tolerance is too small.

IC controler is VIA VL813
needs Firmware update,
USB 3.0 host port with 1A.
Windows8.1x64 works ok.

dont forget to donate to station-drivers.

P.D. Older Factory Default Firmware does Not work in rEFInd, does Not detect OSX boot drives HighSierra/Catalina in Macmini 2014, when USB to SATA case has Asmedia IC.
havent tested the New / Latest Firmware.
This USB Hub is mostly for USB 3.0 mass storage external hdds that does Not have optional AC-DC power input.
like most 1TB / 2TB portable hdd from Toshiba & Seagate.
some computers like Asus M5401 All-In-One does Not have enough power in the USB ports, and unpowered external hdd shutdown.
some ÂµSD readers also shutdown, because the heat, a different problem.
