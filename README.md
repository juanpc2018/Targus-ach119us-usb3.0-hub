small review....

has:
1x micro-USB B 3.0 port to PC/Mac host USB 3.0 A port "input"
1x USB 3.0 micro-B to A cable, fat bold cable = good quality.
1x small Blue LED when connected to host or AC-DC adapter.
3x Blue USB 3.0 A-ports. 1Amp each "Outputs", in theory.
1x Black USB 3.0 that should be Red: "4Amp / Fast Charge", in theory.
1x AC-DC Adapter 5v 4A "in theory", actually: 4.9vdc.
most digital devices fail when voltage is over 5.2vdc because dont have internal voltage regulators, 
only when DC input is 9v-12v or more includes internal voltage regulators. 
4.5v is the minimum threshold, but 4.8v is with in tolerance values.
5.2v is the maximum useable limit.

IC controler is VIA VL813
needs Firmware update,
USB 3.0 host port with 1A.
Windows8.1x64 works ok.

dont forget to donate to station-drivers.
